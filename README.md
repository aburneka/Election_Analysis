## Election-Audit Summary 
The script provided to the Colorado Board of Elections can be used in future elections with the ability to obtain more voter information given additional data. New variables such as **party affiliation or demographic information** can be added and examined using the script in it's current state. 

Additional script such as, if -elif-else statements or nested loops, could be included to explore voter turnout by age group or income ranges, which would be useful for candidates as well as the board of elections.
